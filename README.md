# Docking

This repo is built mostly with copilot and contains tools for Computational Medicinal Chemistry.

docking.py is a guided script that will run autodock vina for a given folder of ligand pdb files and a specified protien. It uses fpocket to discover pockets which can be visualized using Pymol.
